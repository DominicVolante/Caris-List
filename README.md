# Cari's List

Cari's List is a place for people to learn about products that are good for the environment, and how to dispose of them and their packaging.

Cari's List allows users to view products and read about their disposal instructions. It also allows users to visit the website of the company that makes each product.

There is also a list of services that offer monthly memberships.

Users can sort by eco-friendly rating, from eco-friendly, to zero waste.

Users can also filter from all products and services, to kitchen related items, to bathroom related products, to monthly services.
